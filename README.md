# SolSpace
SolSpace is a NOT REAL operating system simulator, and at the moment it is in Spanish. It's written in C#, and the project is created to use an operating system but without having to be installed on a real or virtual machine. In other words, it doesn't have to be installed as a REAL operating system like Microsoft Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
